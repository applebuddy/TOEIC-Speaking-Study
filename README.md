  - -> may try to solve all problems by giving other people money
- I think that there are some disadvantages of motivating elementary school students by giving them money as a reward. 
  First of all, giving money to young students to motivate them gives them the wrong idea about what motivation is. To be specific, students need to learn how to do the right thing based on their morals, (not because they will get a reward for doing it.)
  Secondly, young students may think monetary rewards are the best solution to all problems. For example, when they grow up, they may try to solve problems by giving other people money. Therefore, I think these are some disadvantages of giving monetary  rewards to elementary students to motivate them.
