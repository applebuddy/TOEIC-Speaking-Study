## Q11



**Q(hard) What are the disadvantages of motivating elementary school students by giving them monetary rewards?**

* monetary rewards : 금전적 보상

이유 : 

- 동기부여가 무엇인지에 대한 잘못된 개념을 줌 -> 학생들은 그들의 윤리에 근거하여 옳은 일을 하는 방법을 배워야함
  - gives them the wrong idea about what motivation is
  - -> students need to learn how to do the right thing based on their morals.
- 금전적 보상이 모든 문제의 해결책이라고 생각할 수 있음 -> 다른 사람들에게 돈을 주면서 문제를 해결하려고 할 수 있다.
  - may think monetary rewards are the best solution to all problems.
  - -> may try to solve all problems by giving other people money
- I think that there are some disadvantages of motivating elementary school students by giving them money as a reward. 
  First of all, giving money to young students to motivate them gives them the wrong idea about what motivation is. To be specific, students need to learn how to do the right thing based on their morals, (not because they will get a reward for doing it.)
  Secondly, young students may think monetary rewards are the best solution to all problems. For example, when they grow up, they may try to solve problems by giving other people money. Therefore, I think these are some disadvantages of giving monetary  rewards to elementary students to motivate them.



I agree that young people should be well-informed about current event for a few reasons.

first of all, It helps young people decide their position on a specific issue. so they can decide their position more effectively, and efficiently. 
but, it's not really possible when I think about other options,

also, I think this is what really matters now. society tells young people to be well informed people about current event. but most young people don't follow that. so it's getting more and more important I think.

also, most people think that it is useful when they meet new people. because they can choose many topics to discuss with people.

so these are my reasons.

What are the advantages of studying alone compared to studying in a group?

Give reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.

- First, if I study alone, I can concentrate on my work, become productive, and have a better outcome. So, I can do my work more effectively, and efficiently.
  - studying in a group can be distracting because there's often a sense of competition.
  - some people are more interested in showing off what they know than helping others, which can be annoying.
- also, I think, this is what really matters now. society tells my students to study alone to concentrate on their work. but most student's don't follow that. so it's getting more and more important I think.

Q. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? 

- I agree that employees should not be required to work overtime for several reasons. First, emplyees experience a lot less stress when they go home on time.

- Secondly, working overtime doesn't mean higher work efficiency. First instance, more work means that there are more things to manage simultaneously.
- so it's easier to lose track of tasks. For these reasons, I think employees should not be required to work overtime.
